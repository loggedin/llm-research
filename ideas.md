## Ideas

### Building on PoisonedRAG

Achievable:

- Investigate how different prompts / hyperparameters affect the performance of the attack

### Building on BadRAG

Achievable:

- Investigate how length of poisoned document affect the performance of the attack
- Tune to find the optimal number of documents
- Investigate methods of detection, starting with those highlighted in the paper

Stretch:

- Attempt clustering / anomaly detection as a detection
- Change the algorithm used, e.g. GCG or even introduce a fluency term into the loss function
